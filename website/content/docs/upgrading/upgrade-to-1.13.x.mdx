# Overview

This page contains the list of deprecations and important or breaking changes
for Vault 1.13.x compared to 1.12. Please read it carefully.

## Changes

@include 'consul-dataplane-upgrade-note.mdx'

### Active Directory Secrets Engine Deprecation

The Active Directory (AD) secrets engine has been deprecated as of the Vault 1.13 release.
We will continue to support the AD secrets engine in maintenance mode for six major Vault
releases. Maintenance mode means that we will fix bugs and security issues but will not add
new features. For additional information, see the [deprecation table](/vault/docs/deprecation)
and [migration guide](/vault/docs/secrets/ad/migration-guide).

### AliCloud Auth Role Parameter

The AliCloud auth plugin will now require the `role` parameter on login. This
has always been documented as a required field but the requirement will now be
enforced.

### Mounts associated with removed builtin plugins will result in core shutdown on upgrade

As of 1.13.0 Standalone (logical) DB Engines and the AppId Auth Method have been
marked with the `Removed` status. Any attempt to unseal Vault with
mounts backed by one of these builtin plugins will result in an immediate
shutdown of the Vault core.

-> **NOTE** In the event that an external plugin with the same name and type as
a deprecated builtin is deregistered, any subsequent unseal will continue to
unseal with an unusable auth backend, and a corresponding ERROR log.

```shell-session
$ vault plugin register -sha256=c805cf3b69f704dfcd5176ef1c7599f88adbfd7374e9c76da7f24a32a97abfe1 auth app-id
Success! Registered plugin: app-id
$ vault auth enable -plugin-name=app-id plugin
Success! Enabled app-id auth method at: app-id/
$ vault auth list -detailed | grep "app-id"
app-id/    app-id    auth_app-id_3a8f2e24    system         system     default-service    replicated     false        false                      map[]      n/a                        0018263c-0d64-7a70-fd5c-50e05c5f5dc3    n/a        n/a                      c805cf3b69f704dfcd5176ef1c7599f88adbfd7374e9c76da7f24a32a97abfe1    n/a
$ vault plugin deregister auth app-id
Success! Deregistered plugin (if it was registered): app-id
$ vault plugin list -detailed | grep "app-id"
app-id                               auth        v1.13.0+builtin.vault                                 removed
$ curl --header "X-Vault-Token: $VAULT_TOKEN" --request POST http://127.0.0.2:8200/v1/sys/seal
$ vault operator unseal <key1>
...
$ vault operator unseal <key2>
...
$ vault operator unseal <key3>
...
$ grep "app-id" /path/to/vault.log
[ERROR] core: skipping deprecated auth entry: name=app-id path=app-id/ error="mount entry associated with removed builtin"
[ERROR] core: skipping initialization for nil auth backend: path=app-id/ type=app-id version="v1.13.0+builtin.vault"
```

The remediation for affected mounts is to downgrade to the previously-used version of Vault
environment variable and replace any `Removed` feature with the
[preferred alternative
feature](/vault/docs/deprecation/faq#q-what-should-i-do-if-i-use-mount-filters-appid-or-any-of-the-standalone-db-engines).

For more information on the phases of deprecation, see the [Deprecation Notices
FAQ](/vault/docs/deprecation/faq#q-what-are-the-phases-of-deprecation).

#### Impacted Versions

Affects upgrading from any version of Vault to 1.13.x. All other upgrade paths
are unaffected.

## Known Issues

@include 'tokenization-rotation-persistence.mdx'

@include 'ocsp-redirect.mdx'

### PKI Revocation Request Forwarding

If a revocation request comes in to a standby or performance secondary node,
for a certificate that is present locally, the request will not be correctly
forwarded to the active node of this cluster.

As a workaround, submit revocation requests to the active node only.

#### Impacted Versions

Affects Vault 1.13.0 only.
