# Automated Upgrades

~> **Note**: Automated Upgrades requires [Vault Enterprise](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault/) to be
configured to use Integrated Storage.

Vault Enterprise Automated Upgrades allows operators to upgrade the Vault version currently running in a cluster automatically.
 There are a few different ways to make this upgrade happen,
and control which versions are being upgraded to. With no additional configuration,
Vault will check the version of Vault that each node in the cluster is running. If a blue/green
style deployment is desired, Vault uses the version of your choosing, regardless of
which version of Vault is currently running.

## Configuration
A new key can be added to Vault's `storage` configuration stanza: `autopilot_upgrade_version`.
The value for this key is a [SemVer](https://semver.org/) compatible version string of your choosing.
When a version string is present, it will override the current version of Vault that is running to upgrade automatically.

## Mechanics
Whether you choose to use Vault's built-in version or a version of your own, the mechanics for performing
automatic upgrades remain the same.

When a Vault cluster is running and new nodes containing an updated Vault version join the cluster, the
Autopilot subsystem within Vault will promote the new version nodes to voters when the number of nodes
running the latest Vault version equals or exceeds the number of pre-existing nodes. Vault then demotes
the previous version's nodes to non-voters. Finally, leadership transfers from the prior leader to a
randomly selected node running the newest Vault version and waits for the user to remove the previous
nodes from the cluster.

Below is a flowchart depicting Autopilot's automated upgrade state machine.

The status of the automated upgrade can be monitored by consulting the [Autopilot state API endpoint](/vault/api-docs/system/storage/raftautopilot#get-cluster-state).

## Examples
### Using Vault's built-in version
This is the easiest method to perform an automated upgrade; no configuration is needed, and automated upgrades
are enabled by default.

### Using a blue/green style deploy
Specify something like: `1.11.0-release.1` for the `autopilot_upgrade_version` configuration key in your
existing cluster. When you're ready to deploy a new set of nodes, specify `1.11.0-release.2` for the new
nodes. Any time you need to deploy an updated set of nodes to the cluster, increment the final number.
